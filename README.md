Considering the possible inconvenience brought to the creaters of RSVG and DIOR-RSVG datasets, please contact the authors of *Visual Grounding in Remote Sensing Images* and *RSVG: Exploring Data and Models for Visual
Grounding on Remote Sensing Data* for the permission to use their datasets accordingly. 

Besides, as our proposed network are trained and evaluated partly based on the code provided by the authors of [*Visual Grounding in Remote Sensing Images*], we want to announce our gratitude to them. Also, it means that our proposed RINet can be easily plugged into their training and validating process, which means you can simply import our RINet into their project, but please remember to adjust the hyper-parameters.
